When you contribute code, you affirm that the contribution is your original work and that you license the work to the project under the project's open source license. Whether or not you state this explicitly, by submitting any copyrighted material via pull request, email, or other means you agree to license the material under the project's open source license and warrant that you have the legal authority to do so.

## Guidelines

* Please format your code with `cargo fmt` before sending a pull request! Travis CI will fail
  without this. See [this](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt) for instructions on how to
  auto-format rust code. In particular, make sure you have the *latest* version of `rustfmt`
  installed on your machine!
