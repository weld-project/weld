# Grizzly

This README file assumes for convenience that `WELD_HOME` is set to the `weld` root directory.


### Prerequisites

Build and run tests for Weld (the instructions for this are in `$WELD_HOME/README.md`).  Make sure the `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly as detailed in `$WELD_HOME/python/README.md`.


### Running Grizzly's Unit Tests

To run unit tests, run the following:

```bash
>> python $WELD_HOME/python/grizzly/tests/grizzlyTest    # For Grizzly tests
>> python $WELD_HOME/python/grizzly/tests/numpyWeldTest  # For NumPy tests
```
