# Weld Python Bindings

**NOTE: This package is still a work in progress!** To contribute, see the associated [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/weld-project/weld/milestone/1) if you are interested in contributing!

Weld's Python bindings are generated using PyO3, which requires nightly Rust to build. The recommended way of building it is by using the included `setup.py` script.

```bash
$ rustup default nightly
$ python setup.py develop
```
