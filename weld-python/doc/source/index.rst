Weld Python API
***************

**Current version: 0.3.1**

Welcome to Weld for Python!

This package contains Python bindings to the core Weld API, as well as
subpackages for converting data between primitive Python data types as well as
data types in common Python libraries (e.g., NumPy).

Developers can use this package in two ways. First, they can use the core Weld
APIs to build their own Weld-integrated libraries. Second, they can use the
libraries that already have partial Weld integrations: NumPy and Pandas.

You can install Weld's Python interface with ``pip install weld``. Weld
requires Python >=3.5.
