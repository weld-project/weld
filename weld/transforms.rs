/// Inlines Apply nodes whose argument is a Lambda expression. These often arise during macro
/// expansion but it's simpler to inline them before doing type inference.
/// Unlike many of the other transformations, we make this one independent of types so that
/// we can apply it before type inference.
///
/// Caveats:
/// - Functions that reuse a parameter twice have its expansion appear twice, instead of assigning
///   it to a temporary as would happen with function application.
/// - Does not complete inlining if some of the functions take functions as arguments (in that
///   case, the expressions after inlining may lead to more inlining).
